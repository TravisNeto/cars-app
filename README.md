# Car App!
## Login/Create an account and start browsing. You can add cars to the showroom, check off whether they've been washed or not. You can edit cars and change them to a different car. And you can delete cars from the showroom!
* I decided to make this app because I enjoy cars and thought it would be cool to create my first web app revolving around it.
* Technologies used were JavaScript, HTML, CRUD, RESTful routes, CSS, IMGs. I used Google and Support Time to help navigate through issues.
* Future enhancements would be to really make the page visually look more in depth than it does right now. Maybe eventually add descriptions of the cars.
